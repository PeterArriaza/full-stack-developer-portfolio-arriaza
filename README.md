# My Full Stack Developer Portfolio
[peterarriaza.github.io](https://peterarriaza.github.io)

A website to showcase my talents as a developer and how to get in touch with me.  Created during my full stack web development bootcamp.  

Contains links to my projects and live demos if available.  

Written (mostly) in vanilla JS and mobile friendly.
